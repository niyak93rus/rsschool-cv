## **About me:** 
* I am 28 years old, I began to dream about becoming a developer a couple of years ago. I am very enthusiastic about learning new, especially about technologies and how they can change people's lives.   

* The main reason for me to learn frontend and to look for new projects in it is that it can immediately reward you with the outcomes of your work and knowledge.   

* Previously I have been working as a salesman and then as a hotel receptionist, so I know what people value in products and in different services.   

* I am a good team-worker, I am not overwhelmed by challenges and new ways of work. However, I am also capable of doing routine actions for a long time if it is required, but at the same time I look forward to improve the usual ways of doing them.  
## **Skills:** 
- JavaScript (beginner)
- GIT
- Python (beginner)
- SQL
## **Code examples:** 
Code for Codewars kata "Square Every Digit": this function squares every digit of a number and concatenate them.
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

```
function squareDigits(num){
  let num_string = num.toString();
  let square = 0;
  let new_string = '';


  for(let i = 0; i < num_string.length; i++){
    console.log(square = Math.pow(parseInt(num_string[i], 10), 2));
    new_string = new_string + square;
  }
  return parseInt(new_string, 10);
}
```
