## **About me:** 
* I am 28 years old, I began to dream about becoming a developer a couple of years ago. I am very enthusiastic about learning new, especially about technologies and how they can change people's lives.   

* The main reason for me to learn frontend and to look for new projects in it is that it can immediately reward you with the outcomes of your work and knowledge.
